The "Face Emotion Recognition using Machine Learning" project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for facial emotion detection. CNNs are a class of deep learning models particularly effective in image processing tasks. This approach falls under supervised learning, as the model is trained on labeled datasets where each facial image corresponds to a specific emotion.
